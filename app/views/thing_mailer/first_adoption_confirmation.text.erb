Hi <%= @user.name.split.first %>!

You just adopted one of San Francisco's 25,000 catch basins or storm drains.
Congratulations and thank you for helping to protect the environment, manage
stormwater, and minimize flooding.

Safety tips:

* Never try to lift the drain grate.
* Clear from the sidewalk, not the street. Wear reflective clothing so vehicles
  can see you.
* Always wear gloves and be careful of sharp objects!
* Use a rake, shovel, or broom and dustpan - not your hands.

How to care for your drain:

* If possible, clear the drain before it starts raining.
* Put leaves and other natural material in the green compost bin.
* Put trash and debris in the black garbage bin.
* Clear about 10 feet on both sides of the drain.
* Medical waste or needles? Construction debris? Toxic materials? If it's an
  emergency, call 911. If not, report it to 311 at
  http://www.sf311.org/index.aspx.

If the drain is too dirty or hard to clear or there's some other problem with
the drain, contact 311 to have it cleared by the City.

Thanks again, <%= @user.name.split.first %>, for adopting a drain in our fair
city. When each of us helps out a little, it makes a big difference!

Sincerely,

Your friends at the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission

P.S. Take a picture with your cleared drain and tweet us at @SFWater!

Remember, the City and County of San Francisco won't be held responsible for
anything that happens to you or others in service of maintaining your drain.
Please be careful!
