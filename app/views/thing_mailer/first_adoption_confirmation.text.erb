Hi <%= @user.name.split.first %>!

You just adopted one of San Francisco's 25,000 catch basins or storm drains.
Congratulations and thank you for helping to protect the environment, manage
stormwater, and minimize flooding.

How to clear your adopted drain:
1. If possible, clear the drain BEFORE it starts raining.
2. Put leaves and other natural material in the green compost bin.
3. Put trash and debris in the black garbage bin.
4. Clear about 10 feet on both sides of the drain.

Safety tips:
1. Never try to lift the drain grate. It's really heavy and you might hurt
   yourself.
2. Clear from the sidewalk and wear reflective clothing so cars can see you.
3. Wear gloves and use a rake, shovel, or broom and dustpan.
4. Medical waste? Construction debris? Toxic material? If it's an immediate
   problem, call 9-1-1. If not, report it to 311 at
   http://www.sf311.org/index.aspx.

If the drain is too dirty or hard to clear or there's some other problem with
the drain, contact 311 to have it cleared by the City.

Thanks again, <%= @user.name.split.first %> for adopting a drain in our fair
city. When each of us helps out a little, it makes a big difference!

Sincerely,

Your friends at the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission
