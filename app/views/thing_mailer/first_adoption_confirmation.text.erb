Hi <%= @user.name.split.first %>!

You just adopted one of San Francisco's 25,000 catch basins or storm drains.
Congratulations and thank you for helping to protect the environment, manage
stormwater, and minimize flooding.

How to take care of your adopted drain:

1. If possible, clear the drain BEFORE it starts raining.
2. Put leaves and other natural material in the green compost bin.
3. Put trash and debris in your black garbage bin.
4. Clear about 10 feet on both sides of the drain.

Safety tips:

1. Never try to lift the drain grate. It's really heavy and you might hurt yourself.
2. Clear from the sidewalk and wear reflective clothing so cars can see you.
3. Wear gloves and use a rake, shovel, or broom and dustpan.
4. Medical waste? Needles? Other toxic material? If itâ€™s an immediate problem, 
   call 9-1-1. If not, visit http://www.sf311.org/index.aspx?page=298
   to report it to 311.

What if...

* My drain is too dirty or hard to clear or there's some other problem with my drain.
  * Contact 311 (dial 3-1-1 or go to http://sf311.org) to have it cleared by the City

Thanks again, <%= @user.name.split.first %> for adopting a lonely drain in our fair city. 
When each of us helps out a little, it makes a big difference!

Did you know? You also can Adopt-a-Street (http://sfdpw.org/index.aspx?page=1229)! 
In addition to cleaning your catch basin, you and a neighborhood group can adopt an 
area and take responsibility for helping to keep the street and sidewalk there clean. 
In return, you get to flex your civic pride and the City will provide free rakes, 
brooms, street cleaning supplies, and litter and compostable leaf bag pickup.

Questions? Email us at info@sfwater.org
 
Sincerely,
 
Your friends at the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission
Take a picture with your cleared drain and tweet us at @SFWater

Basic legal stuff:

Remember, the City and County of San Francisco won't be held responsible for
anything that happens to you or others in service of maintaining your drain.
Please be careful!
