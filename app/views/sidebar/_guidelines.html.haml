          What does it mean to adopt a drain?
      .modal-body
        %p.lead
          Thank you for your interest in adopting one or more of the 20,000+ drains in San Franscisco. Caring for a drain can be as simple as just keeping an eye on it. 
        %p
          If it's easy, you can clear it, but if it's not, you can report drain problems to 311 by dialing 3-1-1 on your phone. Remember, put your safety and health first! We just appreciate knowing someone else is helping keep an eye on these important gateways to our sewer system.

          How to keep your drain healthy:
        %ul
          %li
            If possible, clear the drain BEFORE it starts raining.
          %li
            Put leaves and other natural material in your green compost bin.
          %li
            Put trash and debris in your black garbage bin.
          %li
            Clear about 10 feet on both sides of the drain.

          Safety tips:
        %ul
          %li
            Never try to lift the drain grate… it's really heavy and you might hurt yourself!
          %li
            Clear from the sidewalk and wear reflective clothing so cars can see you.
          %li
            Wear gloves and use a rake, shovel, or broom and dustpan.
          %li
            Woah! Medical waste? Needles? Other toxic material? If it's an immediate problem, call 9-1-1. If not, visit http://www.sf311.org/index.aspx?page=298 to report it to 311.
